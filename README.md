imgur reader
============

A quick and dirty web app made with Polymer for my girlfriend to look at cats on imgur. 

[See It In Action](http://projects.deadlytea.com:8000)

To Run
------

Clone the repository to your machine

Open the terminal and cd into the repository root directory

You will need bower to install the components missing
(Requires NodeJS and npm)

```npm install -g bower```

In the root directory of the repo run:

```$ bower install```

This will install any components you need.

I use python for a simple web server, pick whichever you like

With python version 2.*, again in the root directory

```$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer```

Now you should be able to access from your browser at 127.0.0.1:8000

Enjoy :)
